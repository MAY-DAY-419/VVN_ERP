## 🎓 Sibling Detection Logic

The system automatically identifies siblings when:
- Parent/Guardian name is identical
- Contact number is identical

These students are marked as siblings and displayed together in the view.

## 💡 Tips

1. **Roll Numbers**: Make sure each roll number is unique
2. **Contact Numbers**: Enter 10-digit mobile numbers
3. **Search**: Use the search bar to quickly find students
4. **Siblings**: Add all family members to see sibling relationships
5. **Backup**: Regular backup of Supabase data is recommended

### Can't login?
- Verify credentials: `AdminVVN` / `VVN@2025#`
